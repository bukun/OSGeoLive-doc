"GeoExt is a JavaScript library that runs in the browser, it combines and "
"enhances the ExtJS framework and OpenLayers library. This quick start "
"details the steps to create a rich web application using GeoExt "
"components in less than 200 lines of code. We will be using the installed"
" MapServer web services on OSGeoLive a MapServer to supply map layers to "
"the application. Completing the steps below will result in the demo "
"GeoExt application at http://localhost/geoext/."
